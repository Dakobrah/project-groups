## Summary:

This project idea is a website where you can enter a link to a quizlet study set and your phone number, and the website will send you pop quizzes at random times throughout the day. The website would allow you to login and enter your phone number. The user would then submit a link to a quizlet set that they want to study. Our website would scrape the information off of the quizlet and create questions based off the data. There are baseline features listed below, and more complex features would appear throughout the scrum sprints. There would be unique learning features that incoorperte strategies backed by real life educational studies. Overall this project would encorperate all ascpects of software engineering and fullstack development
