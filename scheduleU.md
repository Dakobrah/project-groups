**Brief project description:**

> This project proposes a solution to the time-consuming and challenging
> task of selecting university courses and professors. Our schedule
> maker will assist students in making informed decisions by providing
> comprehensive information about available professors and courses. The
> tool will provide a list of professors for each class, including
> average ratings sourced from popular student review websites such as
> Rate My Professors, Rate My Teachers, Uloop, and more. Additionally,
> the schedule maker will display the required courses for a selected
> major and suggest the best semester placement based on prerequisites
> and availability.
